## Description

This repo is to show work I have done in the past.

I worked with a senior architect I know very well who designed the overall architecture and wrote most of the infrastructure as code portion. I assisted in architectural discussions and decisions as we progressed.

I wrote most of the actual API code, tests and database code as well as many of the packages used by the endpoint flow.

I hope this repo will serve as a place to look at and discuss code I have worked on in the past.
